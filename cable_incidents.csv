"12/2008","","outage","","","","'In December 2008, near the notoriously crowded Alexandria cable station off the Egyptian coastline, an anchor cut three of the four cables connecting Europe to the Middle East. These three cables carried over 90% of the total internet and voice traffic between the two continents. Internet speeds ground to a trickle, and there were knock-on effects across the region. Fourteen countries lost some degree of connectivity, India lost up to 80% and the Maldives 100%, completely cutting them off from the global data network.'
